      question: "What is Arcadia?",
      answer: "Arcadia is an on-chain arcade where you stake USDm (Celo USD) on skill-based games. Your payout depends on your performance - get questions right to increase your multiplier, get them wrong and it decreases. It's like a quiz show where you bet on yourself!",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the multiplier work?",
      answer: "Every game starts at 1.0x. For each correct answer, you gain +0.1x. For each wrong answer or timeout, you lose -0.1x. The multiplier can go below 1.0x, meaning you can lose money! Your final payout is: stake × multiplier × 0.97 (after 3% rake).",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I lose money?",
      answer: "Yes! The multiplier can drop below 1.0x if you get too many questions wrong. For example, if you stake 5 USDm and end at 0.8x, you'll only get back 3.88 USDm (5 × 0.97 × 0.8). This is what makes it exciting - you're betting on your skills!",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a maximum bet?",
      answer: "Yes. The maximum bet is $5 per game (5 USDm on Celo, or 5 STX on Stacks). The cap is enforced on-chain, so no session can ever stake more.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does the bet size change the difficulty?",
      answer: "Yes. The higher your bet, the harder the session: you get fewer seconds per question, tougher questions, and more rounds. A small bet is a short, gentle session; a max bet is a longer, faster, harder one with more upside.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 3% rake?",
      answer: "A 3% entry fee is taken from your stake to fund the house treasury. This ensures the house can always pay out winners. If you stake 5 USDm, 4.85 USDm goes into play. This is standard for gaming platforms.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if the game crashes?",
      answer: "Your funds are safe! If a game fails before settlement, you can request a refund after 1 hour. The smart contract has a cancelExpired() function that returns your stake (minus the 3% rake). This protects you from backend failures.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get USDm?",
      answer: "USDm is Celo's stablecoin (1 USDm = $1 USD). You can get it by: 1) Buying CELO on an exchange and swapping for USDm, 2) Using a fiat on-ramp like MoonPay, or 3) Bridging from another chain.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which games are available?",
      answer: "We have 13 games: Trivia Rush, Letter League, GeoGuess, True/False Blitz, Odd One Out, Emoji Puzzle, Riddle Me This, Capital Quiz, Math Sprint, Name That Landmark, Logo Quiz, Movie Stills, and Hex Match. More coming soon!",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this gambling?",
      answer: "Arcadia is skill-based, not luck-based. Your performance directly determines your payout. However, regulations vary by jurisdiction. We recommend checking your local laws. Bets are capped at $5 per game.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long do I have to answer?",
      answer: "Most games give you 15-20 seconds per question. If time runs out, it counts as a wrong answer and you lose 0.1x from your multiplier. Stay focused!",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I play on mobile?",
      answer: "Yes! Arcadia is fully responsive and works great on mobile devices. The 2-column grid layout makes it easy to browse games on your phone.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is my wallet safe?",
      answer: "Yes. We use RainbowKit for secure wallet connections. You always control your funds - we never have access to your private keys. All transactions require your approval.",
    },
    {
      question: "What blockchain is this on?",
      answer: "Arcadia runs on two mainnets: Celo (stake USDm) and Stacks (stake STX). Both are low-fee, fast networks — pick whichever you prefer with the in-app chain switcher.",
    },
    {
      question: "How are answers verified?",
      answer: "Answers are scored server-side by a trusted backend signer. The correct answer never reaches your browser, preventing cheating. The backend signs your final multiplier, which the smart contract verifies before payout.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I disconnect during a game?",
      answer: "Your session is saved on-chain. If you disconnect, you can't continue that specific game, but after 1 hour you can request a refund. Always try to complete games in one session!",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I play multiple games at once?",
      answer: "No, you can only play one game at a time per wallet. Finish your current game before starting another.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I withdraw my winnings?",
      answer: "Winnings are automatically sent to your wallet when you complete a game and settle on-chain. No withdrawal needed - it's instant!",
    },
